I refined the PlayBlackJack class to meet the project requirements, such as hiding the dealerâ€™s first card unless a Blackjack was dealt initially and adjusting various colors and fonts to match the specifications. This included ensuring cards, backgrounds, and buttons didn't use light gray or white and using a different font from sans serif.",

The project involved building superclasses and subclasses to establish a three-level inheritance hierarchy. I incorporated method overloading with multiple signatures to enhance flexibility and functionality. Additionally, I created JUnit test cases to rigorously test constructors, getter methods, and setter methods, ensuring the reliability of the class structure. Throughout the development, I adhered to sound programming principles to design a clean, efficient, and maintainable class structure. ",
